This is a little Mac Service that helps when you have to put in a bunch of numbers.<br>
Highlight any sequence of numbers and let your mac read them back to you.<br>
I use this service a lot to make sure that i did everything correct.
<br><br>
Source Code for the Service is on <a href="#fixme">my Github</a><br>
